    <h2>ANNAPOLIS VALLEY EXHIBITION IS PLEASED TO PRESENT:</h2>
    <h2>Jess Moskaluke on the Riverside Stage</h2>
    <h2>Saturday Aug 17 @ 8:30pm</h2>
    <p>An internationally celebrated artist, Jess Moskaluke continues to break barriers in the country music world with her big voice, pop infused hooks, and sonic versatility, as seen across her new EP ‘Heartbreaker’. The first Canadian female country artist since Shania Twain to achieve Canadian Platinum single status with the hit ‘Cheap Wine and Cigarettes’, Moskaluke has since gone on to earn Canadian Gold certifications for ‘Take Me Home’, ‘Kiss Me Quiet’, ‘Knock Off’ and her first NUMBER ONE ‘Country Girls’. She was notably the first Canadian female country artist since 2008 to have a song in the Top 3 with ‘Drive Me Away’. The 2017 JUNO Award winner for ‘Country Album of the Year’, Moskaluke has taken home multiple CCMA Awards including ‘Album Of The Year’ (2018) and ‘Female Artist of the Year’ (3X consecutive) and is a 2017 SOCAN Award winner and the 2020 WCM Award winner for ‘Country Artist of the Year’. Her 2021 album The Demos included an ode to her hometown with the hit single ‘Mapdot’ and fan favourite ‘Nothing I Don’t Love About You’, and in 2022 Moskaluke embarked on the Mapdot Tour, her first national headlining run which saw multiple sold out dates across Canada. Continuing to build her international reputation with notable plays at the C2C Music Festival in both Australia and the United Kingdom and with deep roots in the US, Moskaluke’s creativity knows no borders. In addition to her music, Moskaluke is passionate about giving back to causes that are close to her including the MS Society of Canada and Telemiracle Saskatchewan. She continues to explore other avenues including her highly sought-after ‘Handpicked by Jess’ subscription box, where she collaborates with local businesses to share products that she believes in - previous versions of the box have sold out in less than 24 hours.</p>
